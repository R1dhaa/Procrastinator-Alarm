### Project Description
Alarm app where every "Snooze" makes the alarm harder to stop
Final snooze forces you to solve a puzzle or answer a math question

### The Problem statement
Users tend to snooze their alarm repeatedly, leading to delayed waking times and an unproductive morning routine.

### The Solution
Create an alarm clock that doesn't allow the user to snooze unless they complete a small task (e.g. math questions, puzzle solving etc) that forces them to engage and fully wake up before resetting the alarm.

Code that offers a snooze feature, where users can snooze the alarm up to 2 times before being asked to solve a math challenge to snooze again.

1. Setting the Alarm:  
     The user can set the alarm by entering a time in the Alarm Time Input field (e.g., 07:30).     
     Clicking the Set Alarm button activates the alarm functionality.
   
3. Alarm Trigger:  
     The app continuously checks the current time against the alarm time.  
     If they match, the alarm goes off with a motivational message: "Wake up! Time to stop procrastinating!".
   
5. Snooze Functionality:  
     When the alarm goes off, the user can press the Snooze button.  
     After each snooze, the Snooze Count increments. If the user presses snooze more than twice, the app will present a math challenge (e.g., What is 5 + 7?) to delay the alarm.  
     If the user answers correctly, the alarm will snooze. If the answer is wrong, the alarm keeps ringing until the challenge is solved.
