### Project Description
Alarm app where every "Snooze" makes the alarm harder to stop
Final snooze forces you to solve a puzzle or answer a math question

### The Problem statement
Users tend to snooze their alarm repeatedly, leading to delayed waking times and an unproductive morning routine.

### The Solution
Create an alarm clock that doesn't allow the user to snooze unless they complete a small task (e.g., math questions, puzzle solving etc) that forces them to engage and fully wake up before resetting the alarm.
